## Rust CHIP-8 Emulator.
A simple excuse to play around in Rust some more.
Big thanks to Tobias for his article covering a high level implementation for the emulator: https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/

The emulator runs the standard test roms available online successfully, but features some quirks when running more complex games, so implementation is clearly not 100%. \
None of the bundled roms are my own but they're widely available online to test and run.
